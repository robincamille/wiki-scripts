Plain-text indexes from old books + this script = a Wikipedia-ready list of entities for your sandbox!
Use case: which entities in a certain index don't yet have a wiki page?
This script generates 2 txt files: one plain wikipedia-ready list, and one broken into columns.
Copy/paste either list into your wikipedia sandbox and admire the red & blue links.

Example: index at the end of text like http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20393/20393-h/20393-h.htm
generates a list like at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rcamilled/Redlinks

NOTA BENE
You should manually review the items on your generated list.
Script does not work well with complex indexes or diacritics.
