  Plain-text indexes from old books
+ this script
____________________________________
A Wikipedia-ready list of entities!

Use case: which entities in a certain index don't yet have a wiki page?
Copy/paste the generated text in index-wikified.txt into your sandbox page and admire the red and blue links.

Example: index at the end of text like http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20393/20393-h/20393-h.htm
generates a list like at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rcamilled/Redlinks/Printers#Entities_mentioned_in_Peddie

NOTA BENE
You should manually review the items on your generated list.
Script does not work well with complex indexes or diacritics.
Long lists should be in columns (see make-columned-list.py in 'split list into columns' folder).
